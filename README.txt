This very simple CRUD (minus delete) project: PHP with a MySQL database, LAMP stack from exercise directions (I did it through Docker in Windows).

Included are all of the forms, logic, and permission check. It is assumed that it would be implemented into a compatible test environment or you could set up a phpMyAdmin project, import the .sql file, then open web file, (change any needed credentials (example: DB name and password) and launch in a  browser. 

dependencies:  mysqli 

***The wordcount file is a simple PYTHON program I wrote up rather quickly, separate from the php/MySQLi files.
