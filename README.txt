This CRUD (minus delete) project: PHP with a MySQL database, LAMP stack from exercise directions (I did it through Docker in Windows).

Included are all of the forms, logic, and permission check. It is assumed that it would be implemented into a test environment.

It includes some error msg, but I would also add input validation, security from SQLi, etc, if this were to be used in the real world.

dependencies:  mysqli 

***The wordcount file is a simple python program I wrote up, separate from the php/MySQLi files.
